# European graph
Some calculation in graph of European countries

# Run
Run `main.exe` from build folder.

If you want to run script directly, use command `python src/main.py`.
But be attentive: package postman_problems, that used, don't work in latests
versions of python. I use python 3.7 and it works good.
